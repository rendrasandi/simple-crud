# Extremely simple-crud

System requirements :
1. Web Server XAMPP 1.8.3 VC11
2. PHP 5.5.x

Step :
1. Download .ZIP the repository
2. After that, Ekstract the file into htdocs folder in your web server
3. And then you can download "vendor" file in this url : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRbMToPej6nHWvUkfGjUusxA0WED0Lam/view
4. Ekstract it, and replace to simple-crud-master folder in htdocs
5. Last, you can run it on your browser : localhost/simple-crud-master/public

Note :
The vendor file, only I upload in Google Drive because that file have soo many file inside it.
so I can't upload all that files into Github bacause Github give limitation upload only 100 files every commit,
and the vendor file have arround 8000 files.
Actually, it's can do uploading in Github but It will draining the time.
